## Background

I built 'The Quality Times' website during my time on the Northcoders software development bootcamp course.

The website is designed to interact with the backend API that I had previously built. It was developed using React in JavaScript and HTML and styled using CSS and React Bootstrap.
The website allows users to search and filter news articles, interact by voting and adding comments, and to post their own articles.

## Local Development Setup

The guide below will give you all the setup information you need to view this project 'behind the scenes' and, should you wish to, will enable you to make your own contributions.

### Pre-requisites

- Install Node.js which acts as the runtime environment for this project. This should also install npm to manage all of the  
   required dependencies.

  [Follow this link to download Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

  Minimum version recommended: Node v16.8.0

### Clone Repository

### Install Dependencies
